# 🖼️ Image-Generation  

Turn words into images using Artificial Intelligence.  
This project combines **state-of-the-art AI models** with a simple **web interface** so anyone — whether a coder or not — can explore text-to-image generation.

## 🔗 Quick Links  

- **[Run the Gradio App](./frontend_gradio/Gradio_frontend_.ipynb)** – Try generating images instantly  
- **[Explore the Model](./model/)** – View or update trained AI model files  
- **[Work with Embeddings](./embedding/)** – Check stored embeddings and metadata  
- **[Preprocessing Scripts](./clip_image/)** – Dataset preparation notebooks and requirements

## ✨ What This Project Does  

1. **You type a prompt**  
   Example: *“A futuristic city at sunset in cyberpunk style.”*  

2. **AI understands your words**  
   It uses models that connect language with visual concepts.  

3. **AI generates an image**  
   A unique picture is created that matches your description.  

4. **You see the result instantly**  
   The image appears in a simple, user-friendly web interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 🔹 For Non-Coders  
- Just read through the examples and understand how text is turned into images.  
- You don’t need to install anything to know the purpose.  

### 🔹 For Coders  

1. **Clone Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Image-Generation.git
cd Image-Generation
```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
For preprocessing:  
```bash
cd clip_image
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For frontend (Gradio app):  
```bash
pip install gradio torch torchvision
```

3. **Run Gradio Interface**  
```bash
cd frontend_gradio
jupyter notebook Gradio_frontend_.ipynb
```

👉 Open browser: **http://localhost:7860**

## ⚙️ How It Works (Behind the Scenes)  

- **CLIP Embeddings** → Understands the meaning of your text.  
- **Diffusion Model** → Creates images step by step, guided by text meaning.  
- **Refinement** → Ensures the final image matches your words.  
- **Gradio UI** → Lets you type, generate, and view images instantly.  

---

## 📊 Example Use Cases  

- *“A watercolor painting of mountains at sunrise.”*  
- *“A robotic cat sitting on a futuristic chair.”*  
- *“An old library filled with floating candles, in fantasy style.”*  

Each prompt generates a **different, original image**.  

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting  

- **Model Not Loading** → Make sure you installed [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) to download large files.  
- **Poor Output Quality** → Use more descriptive prompts (style, color, mood, details).  
- **Out of Memory** → Reduce image resolution or batch size.
